One of the reasons I came to Linux is I want to rice my system. After searching for the right window manager, I found that [awesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) has the perfect API that I need to rice my system as I want it to be.

## status 
when I started, I thought it will not take much time to rice my system so I didn't use git at that time. But I was wrong. and now the code is full mayhem. So now, I will add what I did before to this repo with comments and a much cleaner code.
